consider two matrices a1 and a2 of sizes p0 X p1 and p1 X p2 respectively.
1. matrix multiplication is not commutative
2. matrix multiplication is associative
3. to get multiplication of 2 matrices we need p0Xp1Xp2 no. of scalar multiplications

consider 5 matrices A1, A2, A3, A4, A5 of sizes p0,p1p2,p
